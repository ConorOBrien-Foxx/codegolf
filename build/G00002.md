Given a string *S* consisting only of lowercase letters `a` through `z` and spaces (or a list of words), find the *number of letters* in the shortest [pangrammatic window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangrammatic_window) in *S*, that is, the size of the span of letters containing all 26 letters of the alphabet with the fewest letters.

You should output `0` if no such window exists in the input.
